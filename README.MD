# Finance Reasoning Chatbot

The **Finance Reasoning Chatbot** is a domain-specific conversational AI system designed to **understand and answer finance-related queries with reasoning capabilities**.  
It is powered by **Hugging Face Transformers** and **DialoGPT**, fine-tuned on financial datasets to give more accurate, relevant, and context-aware responses compared to general-purpose chatbots.

## Overview

Most chatbots provide generic answers because they are trained on general datasets.  
The **Finance Reasoning Chatbot** is different — it is tailored for the **finance domain** and can:
- Interpret **financial terminology**  
- Understand **contextual nuances in finance questions**
- Provide **reasoned responses**, not just definitions  
- Assist in **financial learning, research, and analysis**

Example queries:
- *"Explain the difference between ROI and ROE in simple terms"*
- *"What happens to a bond's price when interest rates go up?"*
- *"How do you calculate the net present value (NPV) of a project?"*
